# CupcakeStand
In this game, you will play the role of a capcake baker. The goal is to make a profit at the end of the day. The day goes by pretty quickly, so get to work...

###Things to know
* When you click "Start", a timer appears and counts down to 0. When the timer ends, the game ends.
* When you click on "Bake a new batch", it creates a batch of 5 cupcakes. 
    * Know that it takes some timet to bake these cupcakes. 
    * Also it costs you $10 to make a new batch.
* Customers will randomly start showing up when you start the day. Don't worry, they are your friends. The more you sell to them, the more money you make. 
    * You will be notified how many cupcakes each customer wants. How many cupcakes a customer wants will be determined in random. They can only be served if you have enough cupcakes in your display.
    * The default price for cupcakes is $3. So your cash should change according to how many cupcakes you've sold your customers.
    * Click "Ring up sale" to complete the transaction.
    * For those who are technically inclined, the customer randomization is created via the following:
        * At a pre-determined set interval, the program does a "GO or NO GO" to determine if it should create new customers. With each "GO", it creates new customers.
        * Customers disappear after they have been served.
* In future functionality of the program, you should be able to set the price of the cupcake. But it's important to know that some customers are price sensitive, and they will not buy expensive cupcakes.
